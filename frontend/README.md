# Frontend

We use Radix UI's Color palette, which are bound to a tailwind-like format of `text-plum-10`. You can see the color reference [here](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

We also use Tailwind's Heroicons, you can see the list of icons [here](https://heroicons.com/).
Use `<icon data-icon="filled/academic-cap" />` to embed the icons in the document.
